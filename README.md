Dude, just got done 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 The Parenting and, wow, what a ride! 😂 It's like... okay, so imagine trying to assemble a piece of IKEA furniture without instructions but with like, zero patience. That's what it felt like those parents were going through. Seriously, every freakin' scene was another plot twist, or at least it felt like it, haha.

You know what I mean when every little thing seems like the end of the world? I swear there's this one part where the dad's just losing it 'cause his kid won’t eat broccoli, and I'm sitting there thinking, been there, man, been there. I mean, sometimes I just wanna 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   scenes of my own life and edit out the chaos. 😅 Anyway, the whole thing hits different when you’re juggling work and then 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 parents lose their minds.

> Oh! There's that one bit where they’re vibing to that old school jam and trying to dance—and failing miserably LOL! Like, who even tries to breakdance at 40?? Reminds me how I attempted the same at the office party and twisted my ankle. Good times...not! 🤦‍♂️

But seriously, some of those parenting moments are pure gold. Reminds me of the madness at our house during holiday 𝘴𝘦𝘢𝘴𝘰𝘯 prep. You know, 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   if you get a chance. It's like seeing a reflection of the circus we call life, but as a spectator, ya feel me?

not_important = why did I even add this?  

And yeah! Let’s chat soon, see if any of those parenting 𝘩𝘢𝘤𝘬s actually work IRL. 🍼 It's like, we all deserve a medal or something for surviving this parenting thing. 😜
